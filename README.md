# Feature-PlayerMovement

This is a fun 2D project that shows how another new feature can be implemented to your game such as Dash mechanism. In some 2D games you might have seen that the player can jump and dash an extra distance, similar to a double jump.

First open the Problem-Statement branch from the branch dropdown of this repository. Use the assets and the corresponding course to design the solution on your own. 

The solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch, I would strongly suggest you to make the solution yourself first.
