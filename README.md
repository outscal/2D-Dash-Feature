# Problem Statement

You are given a scene with all the required assets with a readymade scene.

You will find the instructional course for this project in this github repo:

[Github Course Repo](https://github.com/outscal/2D-Dash-Feature-Instructions.git)

Use the course to think of the requirements for implementing the Dash feature in this readymade. Then you can create a new scene copying the existing one and try the implementation.

The Solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch of this repository. But I suggest you to try for the solution first, where's the fun otherwise eh?
